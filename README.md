## Current Version: 0.1.0

The rgb Color Game is a web game I created that allows people to practice their familiarities with RGB colors.
Upon entering the game, the user can choose between easy and hard modes. (The starting point will be hard mode by default)

For either mode, the user will be provided with a number of squares in different colors. One of them has an RGB value matching the provided value in the title (the section above). If a user selects an incorrect square, the game will asks him/her to try again, and the square will disappear. When the user selects the correct square, all squares will reappear with the same correct color, and the user can choose to play again or switch to another mode.

During any point of the gamne, the user can always reset the game by pressing the button New Colors. This will reset all the colors and the RGB value the user should try to match the square with. 

For Easy Mode, the user will have to choose among 3 squares.
For Hard Mode, the user will have to choose among 6 squares.

## Incoming Version: 0.2.0

Features in Progress:
1. Allows sharing results on Facebook with friends
2. Allows user to customize the number of squares (up to 9)
